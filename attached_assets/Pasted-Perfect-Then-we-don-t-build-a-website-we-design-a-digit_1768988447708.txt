## 1️⃣ WEBSITE PHILOSOPHY (Very Important)

Your website should work in **3 phases**:

| Phase      | Purpose                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Now**    | Brand credibility + lead generation      |
| **Next**   | Product catalog + quote-based checkout   |
| **Future** | Full eCommerce (pricing, cart, payments) |

So we design **everything today**, even if some features are activated later.

![Image](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58cfd41c17bffcb09bd654f0/1711029298421-HILV7HAUJBJZNDNEMF3Z/Coworking%2B1.png)

Each solution page:

* Who it’s for
* Problems solved
* Recommended products
* Layout visuals
* CTA: Request Workspace Plan

This converts **decision-makers**, not casual browsers.

## 6️⃣ CHECKOUT STRATEGY (B2B Friendly)

You don’t force instant payments initially.

### Options:

* **Add to Quote → Admin Approval → Invoice**
* **Bulk pricing rules**
* **GST-ready invoices**
* **Later:** Online payment gateway

This is how serious furniture brands operate.

---

## 7️⃣ TECH STACK RECOMMENDATION (Important)

### Best Options:

* **Frontend:** Next.js / React (fast, scalable)
* **Backend:** Shopify Plus OR Headless Commerce
* **CMS:** Strapi / Sanity
* **Payments:** Razorpay (India)
* **CRM:** Zoho / HubSpot
* **Hosting:** AWS / Vercel

This keeps you future-proof for 5–7 years.
